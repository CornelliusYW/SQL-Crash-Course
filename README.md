Hi! You must be here because of our's ([Cornellius from Non-Brand Data](https://www.nb-data.com/) and [Josep from databites.tech](https://www.databites.tech/)) newest SQL Crash Course.

Whether you're just starting out or looking to sharpen your SQL skills, this series will take you from zero to hero with a structured, easy-to-follow approach. Each post will break down essential SQL concepts, helping you build confidence in SQL following the same style as my previous courses.

We will structure the series into seven key topics to guide you step by step:

1. **Introduction** â€“ What SQL is and why it matters
2. **SQL Fundamentals** â€“ Basic commands, filtering, and aggregation
3. **Intermediate SQL** â€“ Joins, unions, and functions
4. **Advanced SQL** â€“ Subqueries, CTEs, recursion, and views
5. **Database Operations** â€“ CRUD, schema changes, and optimization
6. **Crafting Good SQL Queries** â€“ Best practices for writing efficient queries
7. **Real-world Problems** â€“ Applying SQL to practical challenges

The repository will be updated over time with all the articles and code used in the series, so stay tuned!
